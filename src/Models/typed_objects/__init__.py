"""
typed_objects are objects that provide type hints to the DIRECT UNDERLYING API

The objects are not perfect and some may be missing type annotations

In addition, some keys may not be present when fetching the API as BadDragon does not send all of them
and may potentially change them in the future

These are only to be used if the Models.objects to not store what you are looking for
